<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>David Wild
Student Number: 3817327
S3817327@student.rmit.edu.au
Hello, my name is David, I am 25 year old male from a small country town in northern New South Wales called Tenterfield where I was born and raised. Moved to Brisbane for a couple of years after completing Year 12 where I worked and completed my training as an Electrician, now fully qualified. Recently moved back home to help my parents on their farm and to also work full-time as an IT Trainee at my workplace. Hobbies mainly include anything to do with computers, e.g. playing games, watching movies/Netflix and listening to music, I also have to deal with 3 very stubborn but lovable Corgi’s named Humphrey, Seamus and Dougal.</p>

<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
<p>My main interest in IT has always been something creative, whether that be making games, programming, web design etc. General interest in IT started when I was very little, grew up with computers at school and then we got one at home and I always tried to get on their as much as I could mainly to play games. As I got older I got to see how quickly the internet and IT changed so I wanted to become part of that which where I think I either want to work on a massive game or be a programmer and help create lots of different things. RMIT was chosen as I could learn 100% online which would need my needs and the layout and design of their site looked the “cleanest” to me. At RMIT I expect to learn most of the basic and fundamentals that will help me in my IT career such as communication, working in a team etc, even though I’m not quite sure what specific area I am going to pursue.</p>

<h3> Ideal Job </h3>
<p>My ideal job would be something like the following link, working at CD Projekt Red on one of their games, such as CyberPunk 2077</p>

<p>This position is a fairly broad one that enables you to work with a lot of other people making games, primarily it would be a creative field to propose and work on ideas and designs for the game such as levels, menu’s or interfaces, gameplay etc.
Skills, qualifications and experience needed – require previous experience in the games industry, knowledge of game mechanics and systems and how they impact game design, understanding of some fundamental programming techniques, organisational and communication skills, passion for games and the ability to work as a team.
Some basic understanding of game design and mechanics, organisational and communication skills, passion for games and the ability to work as a team.
Plan for the moment would be to get a degree in IT (not sure on the major/degree I will end up going yet), look online for to try and join a team working on games like an indie game, talk and interact with people online and at events such as PAX etc and how they got started. Behind the scenes of game studios, videos on making games from devs etc.</p>

Visual
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

<p>Big 5 Personality Test Results</p>
<img src="Pictures/yourresults.jpg" alt="Your Results" width="411" heigh="173">
<p>The results mean there are some things I need to work on and things I didn’t know, however not sure of how accurate these are.
In a team these results wont affect me much more than usual, I tend to be fairly quite unless I have some important information or results to show.
When forming a team based on these results, try to find like-minded people that have some similarities on your learning style. I haven’t taking these kinds of results into account the past and haven’t have any previous problems.</p>

<h3> Project Idea </h3>
<p>The design and implementation of a Frequently Asked Questions or Chatterbot program on the website for my currently employer. Given the right implementation this would help decrease the amount of correspondence by phone, email, letter and potentially over in person and it would be a simple and easy way for people to find out simple information before contacting us.
Currently there are roughly about 100 phone calls daily coming through the main switch line where two administration officers work, where they handle most of the incoming traffic and then divert this onto the appropriate departments to then be answered if the two administration officers cannot answer their questions. Along with these two admin officers there are two customer service assistants at the front counter, who deal with over the counter questions and or queries, booking meetings, receiving and sending of parcels, letter etc. and also there is a records officer who also helps with general customer service but mainly focuses on written and electronic communication correspondence.
The Frequently Asked Questions or Chatterbot would help reduce the amount of external communication coming into the company by a implementing a couple of core features. A small prompt would appear after a designated time, lets say after 15 or 30 seconds when being directing to the home page, it would be split into two columns. The left hand column would have 3 layers to it for information to be displayed on. On the top layer of the left hand side of the prompt would be a drop-down menu or selection list of the appropriate department that they would like to be directed to, this could be the Financial department, Community, Workshop etc, when selecting one of these options it would then bring up some more details drop down lists or if the department didn’t have many sub categories it could be the most important information, e.g. if it was the waste department it could be: When are my bins collection days with a map of the town one which days your bin will be collected and what type of bin to put out or how much it if for a skip bin to be delivered and emptied. If the department was a bit more complex, say Financial there would be a couple of sub-heading for Overdue notices, overdue invoices, upcoming deadlines, check your balance here, important information/urgent notices. These sub-headings would then drill down to the final page where all the information such as the FAQ’s are located for the previous sub-headings and headings after the user has drilled down if they needed a questions to a specific question.
<p>The right hand side of the prompt when on the homepage of the website would be the chatterbot section, this would be where users who aren’t quite sure where to direction their queries to could enter a question and then be directed to the information directly without having to drill down through the headings and sub-headings on the left hand side of  the prompt. An example could be “what time is the screening of the next Avengers movie being shown? This would then display the showing time, movie being played and possibly the cost. It could even have a link at the end that would take then directly to the full schedule for movies that are being shown and upcoming as well as the different prices for adults/children etc.
With limited information regarding the tools and technologies that would be required, it would have to be a combination of htlm/javscript or something similar to deal with the drop down menus/lists if users wanted to find their information that way, or ChatBot (https://www.chatbot.com/) which would handle the right hand side of the prompt window, dealing with questions the ChatBot would be able to give automatic replies based on the query or direct them to the appropriate staff if they needed to speak with someone in person.</p>
<p>The skills required for this would be experience in web design and programming such as html and javascript as well as a basic understanding of the workings of the company and the policies and procedures that they are require to work in and around with, such as their customer service guidelines. No special hardware would be required for this project. The feasibility of being able to find someone with the relevant skills and qualifications required would be fairly simple if posted online, someone with prior experience with integration customer services and automation software.</p>
<p>The outcome if the project was successful would be a decrease in the amount of communication coming in directly through phones, email and letters and members of the community would have a greater access to basic information through better and more diverse forms of communication.  This will help alleviate the original problem of a few administrative and customer service staff having to be the bottle neck of all communication that comes in externally and then be redirected to the appropriate department and or staff by giving basic information and then directing onto the departments. This will dramatically reduce stress and increase efficiency of staff as the time and workload would be decreased from answering these incoming communications.</p>
